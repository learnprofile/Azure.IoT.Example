            <center><b>I'm not a lawyer. What does all this MEAN?</b></center>
            <br />
            Describing legal documents in non-legalese is fraught with potential for misinterpretation. Notwithstanding the text that follows,
            the actual text of the license itself is legally binding and authoritative.
            <br /><br />
            That said, here's what this license intends to say in layman's terms:
            <br /><br />
            <i>
                "Luppes Consulting, Inc. is not responsible for any of the code used in or generated by these tools.
                By using this tool, you accept all responsibility to validate, confirm, and test the code to make sure it does what you want it to,
                and you do not hold Luppes Consulting responsible for anything that happens from the use of code generated by this tool, even if it
                somehow manages to delete all of the data in your very important database."
